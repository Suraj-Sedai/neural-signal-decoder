        "\n",
        "#### Function Parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`class_id`**: An integer representing the 'action' or mental state (0 for 'Left', 1 for 'Right', 2 for 'Up', 3 for 'Down'). Each class is associated with a distinct frequency band.\n",
        "*   **`num_channels`**: The number of simulated EEG channels.\n",
        "*   **`num_timesteps`**: The number of data points (samples) in the time series for each channel.\n",
        "*   **`sampling_rate`**: The number of samples per second (default is 256 Hz, common in EEG).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### How the Signal is Generated (Mathematical Explanation):\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Time Axis (`t`)**:\n",
        "\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    t = np.arange(num_timesteps) / sampling_rate\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   `np.arange(num_timesteps)` creates an array of integers from `0` to `num_timesteps - 1`. These represent the sample indices.\n",
        "    *   Dividing by `sampling_rate` converts these sample indices into actual time values in seconds. For example, if `sampling_rate` is 256, the first sample is at `t=0`, the second at `t=1/256`, the third at `t=2/256`, and so on.\n",

        "3.  **Signal Generation per Channel**:\n",
        "\n",
